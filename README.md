👋 Hi, I’m Shiv Shankar Singh, a dedicated astrophysicist and data science professional bridging the fascinating realms of astrophysics and artificial intelligence.

🌌 **Astrophysics & Machine Learning**: I focus on creating machine learning models to enhance our understanding of cosmic phenomena. My Master's thesis under Prof. Jasjeet Singh Bagla, titled 'Simulation studies of black holes originating in globular clusters,' demonstrates my expertise in this interdisciplinary field.

📊 **Data Science Proficiency**: My extensive experience includes handling large datasets, insightful data visualization, predictive modelling, and implementing machine learning projects such as image classification with both Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks.

🌍 **Weather & Climate Studies**: Collaborating with the Weather and Climate Modelling group at IISER-M, I work with large historical datasets to study weather patterns and project future climate conditions. I'm currently developing an automated system to calculate climate indices using temperature and precipitation data.

🎓 **Educational Background**: Holding a Master's degree in Physics from IISER Mohali and a minor in Data Science and Machine Learning, I also have a specialization in Applied Data Science and Machine Learning from the University of Michigan. I am further exploring Deep Learning and its potential societal applications.

🚀 **Contributions & Opportunities**: With my unique skill set, I am open to opportunities for valuable contributions to academia and industry. I am enthusiastic about fostering new discoveries and advancements in the fields of astrophysics and data science.
